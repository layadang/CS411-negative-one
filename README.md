# CS411 Team Negative One: Movie Recommendation Project

## Overview

This is a Movie Recommendation project that provides personalized movie recommendations to users. It utilizes a Flask-based front-end, a custom-trained Language Model (LLM) recommendation system, the IMDb public sample API, Google OAuth for authentication, and MongoDB to store user information. The project combines these technologies to deliver a seamless movie recommendation experience. The user interface is similar to Tinder. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in using their Google accounts via OAuth, ensuring secure and authenticated access to the system.

- **Movie Recommendations**: The core of the project is a custom-trained Language Model (LLM) recommendation system through Google Vertex AI. It provides movie recommendations based on a user's preferences and viewing history.

- **IMDb Public Sample API**: The project uses the IMDb public sample API to fetch movie data, including titles, ratings, and descriptions.

- **User Profile**: User information, including their watchlist and ratings, is stored in a MongoDB database, enabling the system to personalize recommendations.
