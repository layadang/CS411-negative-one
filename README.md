# CS411 Team Negative One: Movie Recommendation Project

## Overview

This is a Movie Recommendation project that provides personalized movie recommendations to users. It utilizes a Flask-based front-end, LLM recommendation system through OpenAI, the IMDb public sample API, Google OAuth for authentication, and MongoDB to store user information. The project combines these technologies to deliver a seamless movie recommendation experience. The user interface is similar to Tinder. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in using their Google accounts via OAuth, ensuring secure and authenticated access to the system.

- **Movie Recommendations**: ChatGPT API is prompted with info about the user, and it provides movie recommendations based on a user's preferences and viewing history.

- **RapidAPI MovieDatabase**: The project uses the MovieDatabase API from RapidAPI to fetch movie data, including titles, years, images, genres, and plots.

- **User Profile**: User information, including their likes, dislikes, and starred movies, is stored in a MongoDB database.
