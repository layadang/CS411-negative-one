Leaving the place he calls home; turning his back on everything he holds dear - to embrace the uncertainty of a life across the water is no small adventure. His mother has allegedly set up a life in America. At a glance this may appear like clever resolve but a bolder definition presents deeper challenge for the stereotype local boy, drunk as a rule, never backs down from the fight.\n\nSlugger O'Toole isn't just a character in a song, he's a street scrapper and stands undefeated. Fond of his gargle, fond of his ladies, he certainly doesn't turn many corners without his share of drama. Forced into local trouble with the higher ranked paramilitary boys, on both sides, Slugger must now face a quiet exile and is given the choice of anywhere in the world to disappear.\n\nWith the potential of family across the water, his exit may be softer than it appears but the problem with geographical solutions - he takes his problems with him. New Orleans has a new set of concerns, and water sinks to its own level.\n\nA new love interest; an ongoing feud with local Cartels; the reunion of family controversy; a well lubricated street fighting career; all contributes to an increasingly fatal alcohol dependency issue, then the demons that accompany that. Slugger is deluded. Just when it all seems to find solution, problems seem to reach their end, the real problem stands face to face with Slugger in the mirror. His fight was within himself."

His heir Mikhail finds himself in the middle of two worlds - the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the ancient lands of Perm populated by pagans. Mikhail marries a local girl, Tiche, a half woman, a half lamia - a witch, a living incarnation of the main pagan symbol Golden Woman, Sorni Nai. The legend has it that whoever owns Sorni Nai, has the full control over Parma. A talented diplomate, Mikhail finds allies among the local khans. He is able to bring a fragile peace but the news about the increasingly powerful Permian Prince reaches Moscow. The Grand Prince Ivan III decides to overpower Mikhail and his allies. He intends to turn disparate Rus into a uniform and strong state, realizing that the peoples can't repel the endless invasions of the Russian lands on their own. Mikhail has a difficult choice to make: to accept the will of Moscow or to stick with the local rulers who had helped him more than once in the past and many of whom became his loyal friends. Mikhail decides to listen to his heart and not the reason and ultimately loses the battle against the Grand Prince of Moscow and with his friends and allies ends up in captivity. In the meantime, Tiche is kidnapped by Mikhail's bitter enemy Assyka who wants to regain his control over Parma, believing that Tiche the lamia is his and his alone."

Over time, fever mutates and remedies are no longer enough. But by chance they discover a new way to calm her down, establishing a healing mechanism between them; Isolda has a crisis and Aura calms her down in a sort of sex ritual and ice baths in the tub. To the point that the limit between having sex to heal or get sick to have sex is lost. The episodes arise from some disgust or sadness; mechanisms that Aura has always managed to handle in a timely manner, thus having control of Isolda's love and desire. Starting a new stage, they move to live together establishing themselves as a couple, but Tomás comes to Isolda's life with new experiences. And after brief encounters, he ends up being the key element to disrupt the world of Isolde, allowing him to understand where his attacks come from and what to do with them. While the relationship with Tomás grows, the one he has with Aura is diluted, everything collapses and Isolda will have nothing left but to assume and take charge."

Billy comes home, drowsy from the tetanus shot, and bonds with Gina's lovely new caregiver Myra (Jess Paul). Then the rat fur appears. It grows out of Billy's skin, then goes away like it was never there. The more Billy looks in the mirror and scratches, the more he's forced to face the unthinkable: he might be turning into a rat. Billy is plunged into a waking nightmare where he slowly discovers the truth about himself as he unleashes the ferocious depths of the human and rodent soul."

        "plot": "We stand in the South African bush with Professor Lee Berger, the Paleoanthropologist who discovered the richest early hominid site yet found on the continent of Africa and a new species of human relative, Homo naledi, and, looking around the site of his discoveries, he says: \"Do you know why you feel at home in these surroundings?...because we are all indigenous from here. Everywhere else on this planet we have imposed ourselves; here, the trees, the plants, the animals, have gotten used to the human species and its evolution for millions of years...\" It is in this \"cradle of humankind\" that Artist Caroline Bittermann has been invited by the Nirox Foundation in South Africa to add an artwork to their permanent collection. Caroline has long been working with the concept of the historical English Landscape Garden, where ruins often had critical political impacts in expressing the rebellious opinions of the garden-owners. Here in South Africa, the Artist has created a sculpture in the form of a gate in ruin. The gate in ruin forms a word and is installed at the border between the pristine European looking landscape gardens of the Nirox Foundation and the wild African bush. The word SAN falls apart into three elements: a bench, a pyramid, and two columns. These elements are made out of natural stones, used burned bricks, and dented corrugated sheets, rusty steel, and plants. The word SAN is written on the ground inside the pyramid by the rising sun and gets smaller and smaller as sunlight travels through the day. The SAN population is slowly disappearing from our planet... Thus begins a film dialogue between an artist and renowned scientists in the field of genetic research, anthropology, and cognitive archaeology around the discourse of the beginning of our civilization. The film looks at the SAN people, today \"actors\" of their own culture in \"Living Museums\", as carriers of the oldest DNA markers on the tree of our evolution. To affirm or oppose this theory, we sample and compare a SAN woman's and Caroline Bittermann's DNA with Geneticist Professor Himla Soodyall at the Wits University research laboratory. While the DNA comparison reveals its scientific undeniable truth, we also reflect on the SAN's importance in the origin of art, communication and ritual communal behavior. Exploring caves in Cederberg and Drakensberg, we question David Pearce, Jean-Loïc Le Quellec and Pippa Stoknes on the cultural impact of the SAN people's rock paintings and artifacts making Africa the continent where our \"Modern Man's\" civilization began.To clarify the position of the modern humans in the story of mankind, we construct, with Professor Lee Berger, an animated time line of our evolution, in light of his recent major discoveries. If the SAN people are the foundation of human origin, should the world tolerate that their footsteps are definitely being covered over by the red dust of the Kalahari...? Is their extinction unavoidable? Are human reservations the solution? If we all are descendants of the SAN people, doesn't the light that the artist shines on them cast a shadow on the concept of \"race\"?"

He reveals in unsettling detail how the US military-industrial complex pushes a version of history that scrubs the screen of war crimes, corruption, criticism of the nuclear arsenal, racism, sexual assault, assassinations, and torture. From James Bond to Jack Ryan, Captain Marvel to Cake Boss, the creation of this other \"cinematic universe\" is one of the great PR coups of our time."

These men and women have jobs that require a willingness to face things that most of us can't even imagine, yet maintain a high level of dignity and professionalism. First responders in fact repeatedly see and experience things that most of us will never see, causing compound issues related to post-traumatic stress injuries and disorders. Suicide rates among first responder groups in the United States are much higher than the general population. In 2016, 139 firefighters died by suicide; and in 2019, 228 police officers died by suicide, nearly twice the number of officers who died in line of duty. Both firefighters and police officers are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty. Many first responders self-medicate with alcohol or other self-destructive and abusive behaviors in an effort to cope with the stress and trauma they deal with daily. And unfortunately, many of their agencies are not providing them a supportive environment where they can get help. If first responders don't get the help they need and deserve, who will answer the call to your next emergency? Will they be healthy? Our nation's first responder agencies must provide a healthy and safe environment for these men and women to ask for help if they are struggling to deal with the trauma they've encountered. Our communities depend on them. Their families depend on them."

As the pair embark on their journey in a junky '62 Ford Fairlane, they confront their heartaches and misperceptions, eventually opening the door to forgiveness for two women who are biologically tied, yet have lived their lives as strangers. This dark comedy threads humor into otherwise heartbreaking situations and reminds us that life truly is about embracing the moments."

Together, they go to the Colonel's Wife manor (Agnieszka Grochowska), where Kosciuszko is hiding, waiting for negotiations with the magnates. Kos is distrustful of Ignac and keeps him under arrest, but at the decisive moment it is in the hands of an inconspicuous noble bastard who will lay the fate of the uprising.

Lanka Reddy is brutal, mindless... barbaric killing machine.\n\nDetermined to destroy every existence of rebels including Lanka Reddy, the expert in jungle-war-fare, IPS officer Neerja Madhavan is fighting on the three fronts simultaneously. First: Emotional balance-act within her own family, second: Ideological war in the system run essentially by dishonest, corrupt and cowardly leadership and third: jungle-war to free the people of Bastar from the terror of Maoists.\n\nNeerja meets Ratna Kashyap. Ratna's husband is cut into 32 pieces in the Maoist's people's court on the charge of hoisting Indian flag and took effort to bringing a road to the village. She also has to paint a wall with the blood of her husband - that is the order of guerillas. The guerillas also take Raman, Ratna's teenage son. Vowed to take revenge, she joins local Police. Ratna takes police training to fight the Maoists in jungle while her son Raman is being trained by Maoist to fight the police & security forces.\n\nNeerja's continuous camping in the forest to end the guerilla regime and the unprecedented people's resistence against the terror, called Salwa-Judum (Peace march), disturbs Lanka Reddy. He, like a wounded animal, killed 76 Indian soldiers in the middle of the night. The whole country mourns but unfortunately a section of intellectuals-journalists-lawyers-NGOs celebrate in defferent parts of the country.\n\nNeerja needs additional police force to surround Lanka Reddy from all sides and brought him to justice. Neerja takes the fights to Home Minister's office in Delhi for institutional apathy. And, back in Bastar she enters the forest in a tactfully planned combing operation. During the war in jungle, ironically Ratna is with Neerja and her son Raman is with Lanka Reddy.\n\nThe heat of Neerja's force reaches Lanka Reddy. To escape from the Neerja's trap, Lanka Reddy activates his urban support system. The Supreme Court case against Salwa-Judum, image-management of Maoists to Maoist fund-management and safe escape-route for Lanka Reddy are ensured by this urban system.\n\nIn an encounter Neerja gets seriously injured. To add more to her misery, she gets charge-sheet for killing villagers in a fake-encounter, with a suspension order. Also, honorable Supreme Court bans the Salwa Judum movement.\n\nOn the orders of victorious Lanka Reddy, the Maoists unleashed series of brutal and mindless terror attacks on the people of Bastar. Maoists attack Salwa Judum's biggest leader Mahendra Karma. 32 political leaders are killed in this unprecedented guerilla attack in Jheeram Valley. Karma hit by 82 bullets and stabbed 92 times.\n\nRatna, who is on duty with Mahendra Karma's security team after Neerja is injured, comes face to face with Raman her son, a Maoist guerilla now, with a gun in hand. Mother and son face to face at the battlefield.\n\nInjured Neerja lost her baby in her womb. Almost at the same time she gets her suspension letter from Delhi. But Neerja's heavy breathing is not for her lost baby or her suspension... She is breathlessly waiting for a news! She believes - Lanka Reddy will be arrested soon. The trap she laid for Lanka - that cannot go wrong this time!\n\nCan Neerja finally be Happy this time? Neerja leaves the hospital with her husband and goes to an orphanage where hundreds of orphans of war-ridden Bastar live. Ratna's daughter Rama is also there.\n\nNeerja takes Rama with her. Both climb the mountain while walking. Otherside of the mountain is Rama's village. Rama has to meet her brother; She has to go to her village - she is inconsolable. Neerja hopes that one day Rama will definitely go to her village."
