Leaving the place he calls home; turning his back on everything he holds dear - to embrace the uncertainty of a life across the water is no small adventure. His mother has allegedly set up a life in America. At a glance this may appear like clever resolve but a bolder definition presents deeper challenge for the stereotype local boy, drunk as a rule, never backs down from the fight.

Slugger O'Toole isn't just a character in a song, he's a street scrapper and stands undefeated. Fond of his gargle, fond of his ladies, he certainly doesn't turn many corners without his share of drama. Forced into local trouble with the higher ranked paramilitary boys, on both sides, Slugger must now face a quiet exile and is given the choice of anywhere in the world to disappear.

With the potential of family across the water, his exit may be softer than it appears but the problem with geographical solutions - he takes his problems with him. New Orleans has a new set of concerns, and water sinks to its own level.

A new love interest; an ongoing feud with local Cartels; the reunion of family controversy; a well lubricated street fighting career; all contributes to an increasingly fatal alcohol dependency issue, then the demons that accompany that. Slugger is deluded. Just when it all seems to find solution, problems seem to reach their end, the real problem stands face to face with Slugger in the mirror. His fight was within himself."

Through the Tear,2022,Documentary,"We stand in the South African bush with Professor Lee Berger, the Paleoanthropologist who discovered the richest early hominid site yet found on the continent of Africa and a new species of human relative, Homo naledi, and, looking around the site of his discoveries, he says: ""Do you know why you feel at home in these surroundings?...because we are all indigenous from here. Everywhere else on this planet we have imposed ourselves; here, the trees, the plants, the animals, have gotten used to the human species and its evolution for millions of years..."" It is in this ""cradle of humankind"" that Artist Caroline Bittermann has been invited by the Nirox Foundation in South Africa to add an artwork to their permanent collection. Caroline has long been working with the concept of the historical English Landscape Garden, where ruins often had critical political impacts in expressing the rebellious opinions of the garden-owners. Here in South Africa, the Artist has created a sculpture in the form of a gate in ruin. The gate in ruin forms a word and is installed at the border between the pristine European looking landscape gardens of the Nirox Foundation and the wild African bush. The word SAN falls apart into three elements: a bench, a pyramid, and two columns. These elements are made out of natural stones, used burned bricks, and dented corrugated sheets, rusty steel, and plants. The word SAN is written on the ground inside the pyramid by the rising sun and gets smaller and smaller as sunlight travels through the day. The SAN population is slowly disappearing from our planet... Thus begins a film dialogue between an artist and renowned scientists in the field of genetic research, anthropology, and cognitive archaeology around the discourse of the beginning of our civilization. The film looks at the SAN people, today ""actors"" of their own culture in ""Living Museums"", as carriers of the oldest DNA markers on the tree of our evolution. To affirm or oppose this theory, we sample and compare a SAN woman's and Caroline Bittermann's DNA with Geneticist Professor Himla Soodyall at the Wits University research laboratory. While the DNA comparison reveals its scientific undeniable truth, we also reflect on the SAN's importance in the origin of art, communication and ritual communal behavior. Exploring caves in Cederberg and Drakensberg, we question David Pearce, Jean-Loïc Le Quellec and Pippa Stoknes on the cultural impact of the SAN people's rock paintings and artifacts making Africa the continent where our ""Modern Man's"" civilization began.To clarify the position of the modern humans in the story of mankind, we construct, with Professor Lee Berger, an animated time line of our evolution, in light of his recent major discoveries. If the SAN people are the foundation of human origin, should the world tolerate that their footsteps are definitely being covered over by the red dust of the Kalahari...? Is their extinction unavoidable? Are human reservations the solution? If we all are descendants of the SAN people, doesn't the light that the artist shines on them cast a shadow on the concept of ""race""?"

These men and women have jobs that require a willingness to face things that most of us can't even imagine, yet maintain a high level of dignity and professionalism. First responders in fact repeatedly see and experience things that most of us will never see, causing compound issues related to post-traumatic stress injuries and disorders. Suicide rates among first responder groups in the United States are much higher than the general population. In 2016, 139 firefighters died by suicide; and in 2019, 228 police officers died by suicide, nearly twice the number of officers who died in line of duty. Both firefighters and police officers are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty. Many first responders self-medicate with alcohol or other self-destructive and abusive behaviors in an effort to cope with the stress and trauma they deal with daily. And unfortunately, many of their agencies are not providing them a supportive environment where they can get help. If first responders don't get the help they need and deserve, who will answer the call to your next emergency? Will they be healthy? Our nation's first responder agencies must provide a healthy and safe environment for these men and women to ask for help if they are struggling to deal with the trauma they've encountered. Our communities depend on them. Their families depend on them."

Bastar: The Naxal Story,2024,"Crime, Drama","Hoisting the national flag is a crime, punishable by death under the Maoist law in Bastar, bang at the center of independent India. Indian Maoists or radical leftists, who are also know as Naxals, have taken thousands of lives and destroyed of millions of dollars worth of national assets in the blazing flames of communism laboratory, in little over last fifty years.

The plot is set around 2007-12, when the Indian Maoists are running a parallel government in more than a hundred districts of the country. Because of its unique geo-political position, the guerillas have made the Bastar (a region of the newly born state of Chhattisgarh) as their capital - the epicenter of deadly Maoists activites. The epicenter, i.e, the liberated-zone from where they run their government. From land-registration to governance and revenue, everything is governed by their rule. Defying that is death.

The Maoist track in the plot is represented by Lanka Reddy, a dreaded guerilla commander and the Command-in-Chief of Central Military Commission: the apex body of the Maoists' military wing in India. Lanka Reddy is brutal, mindless... barbaric killing machine.

Determined to destroy every existence of rebels including Lanka Reddy, the expert in jungle-war-fare, IPS officer Neerja Madhavan is fighting on the three fronts simultaneously. First: Emotional balance-act within her own family, second: Ideological war in the system run essentially by dishonest, corrupt and cowardly leadership and third: jungle-war to free the people of Bastar from the terror of Maoists.

Neerja meets Ratna Kashyap. Ratna's husband is cut into 32 pieces in the Maoist's people's court on the charge of hoisting Indian flag and took effort to bringing a road to the village. She also has to paint a wall with the blood of her husband - that is the order of guerillas. The guerillas also take Raman, Ratna's teenage son. Vowed to take revenge, she joins local Police. Ratna takes police training to fight the Maoists in jungle while her son Raman is being trained by Maoist to fight the police & security forces.

Neerja's continuous camping in the forest to end the guerilla regime and the unprecedented people's resistence against the terror, called Salwa-Judum (Peace march), disturbs Lanka Reddy. He, like a wounded animal, killed 76 Indian soldiers in the middle of the night. The whole country mourns but unfortunately a section of intellectuals-journalists-lawyers-NGOs celebrate in defferent parts of the country.

Neerja needs additional police force to surround Lanka Reddy from all sides and brought him to justice. Neerja takes the fights to Home Minister's office in Delhi for institutional apathy. And, back in Bastar she enters the forest in a tactfully planned combing operation. During the war in jungle, ironically Ratna is with Neerja and her son Raman is with Lanka Reddy.

The heat of Neerja's force reaches Lanka Reddy. To escape from the Neerja's trap, Lanka Reddy activates his urban support system. The Supreme Court case against Salwa-Judum, image-management of Maoists to Maoist fund-management and safe escape-route for Lanka Reddy are ensured by this urban system.

In an encounter Neerja gets seriously injured. To add more to her misery, she gets charge-sheet for killing villagers in a fake-encounter, with a suspension order. Also, honorable Supreme Court bans the Salwa Judum movement.

On the orders of victorious Lanka Reddy, the Maoists unleashed series of brutal and mindless terror attacks on the people of Bastar. Maoists attack Salwa Judum's biggest leader Mahendra Karma. 32 political leaders are killed in this unprecedented guerilla attack in Jheeram Valley. Karma hit by 82 bullets and stabbed 92 times.

Ratna, who is on duty with Mahendra Karma's security team after Neerja is injured, comes face to face with Raman her son, a Maoist guerilla now, with a gun in hand. Mother and son face to face at the battlefield.

Injured Neerja lost her baby in her womb. Almost at the same time she gets her suspension letter from Delhi. But Neerja's heavy breathing is not for her lost baby or her suspension... She is breathlessly waiting for a news! She believes - Lanka Reddy will be arrested soon. The trap she laid for Lanka - that cannot go wrong this time!

Can Neerja finally be Happy this time? Neerja leaves the hospital with her husband and goes to an orphanage where hundreds of orphans of war-ridden Bastar live. Ratna's daughter Rama is also there.

Neerja takes Rama with her. Both climb the mountain while walking. Otherside of the mountain is Rama's village. Rama has to meet her brother; She has to go to her village - she is inconsolable. Neerja hopes that one day Rama will definitely go to her village."
