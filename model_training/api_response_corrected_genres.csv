Through the Tear,2022,"We stand in the South African bush with Professor Lee Berger, the Paleoanthropologist who discovered the richest early hominid site yet found on the continent of Africa and a new species of human relative, Homo naledi, and, looking around the site of his discoveries, he says: ""Do you know why you feel at home in these surroundings?...because we are all indigenous from here. Everywhere else on this planet we have imposed ourselves; here, the trees, the plants, the animals, have gotten used to the human species and its evolution for millions of years..."" It is in this ""cradle of humankind"" that Artist Caroline Bittermann has been invited by the Nirox Foundation in South Africa to add an artwork to their permanent collection. Caroline has long been working with the concept of the historical English Landscape Garden, where ruins often had critical political impacts in expressing the rebellious opinions of the garden-owners. Here in South Africa, the Artist has created a sculpture in the form of a gate in ruin. The gate in ruin forms a word and is installed at the border between the pristine European looking landscape gardens of the Nirox Foundation and the wild African bush. The word SAN falls apart into three elements: a bench, a pyramid, and two columns. These elements are made out of natural stones, used burned bricks, and dented corrugated sheets, rusty steel, and plants. The word SAN is written on the ground inside the pyramid by the rising sun and gets smaller and smaller as sunlight travels through the day. The SAN population is slowly disappearing from our planet... Thus begins a film dialogue between an artist and renowned scientists in the field of genetic research, anthropology, and cognitive archaeology around the discourse of the beginning of our civilization. The film looks at the SAN people, today ""actors"" of their own culture in ""Living Museums"", as carriers of the oldest DNA markers on the tree of our evolution. To affirm or oppose this theory, we sample and compare a SAN woman's and Caroline Bittermann's DNA with Geneticist Professor Himla Soodyall at the Wits University research laboratory. While the DNA comparison reveals its scientific undeniable truth, we also reflect on the SAN's importance in the origin of art, communication and ritual communal behavior. Exploring caves in Cederberg and Drakensberg, we question David Pearce, Jean-Loïc Le Quellec and Pippa Stoknes on the cultural impact of the SAN people's rock paintings and artifacts making Africa the continent where our ""Modern Man's"" civilization began.To clarify the position of the modern humans in the story of mankind, we construct, with Professor Lee Berger, an animated time line of our evolution, in light of his recent major discoveries. If the SAN people are the foundation of human origin, should the world tolerate that their footsteps are definitely being covered over by the red dust of the Kalahari...? Is their extinction unavoidable? Are human reservations the solution? If we all are descendants of the SAN people, doesn't the light that the artist shines on them cast a shadow on the concept of ""race""?",Documentary

Ptsd911,2022,"PTSD911 is a documentary film about real people: normal, average human beings who have chosen to work in professions that require above average heroism, fortitude, and resolve. These men and women have jobs that require a willingness to face things that most of us can't even imagine, yet maintain a high level of dignity and professionalism. First responders in fact repeatedly see and experience things that most of us will never see, causing compound issues related to post-traumatic stress injuries and disorders. Suicide rates among first responder groups in the United States are much higher than the general population. In 2016, 139 firefighters died by suicide; and in 2019, 228 police officers died by suicide, nearly twice the number of officers who died in line of duty. Both firefighters and police officers are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty. Many first responders self-medicate with alcohol or other self-destructive and abusive behaviors in an effort to cope with the stress and trauma they deal with daily. And unfortunately, many of their agencies are not providing them a supportive environment where they can get help. If first responders don't get the help they need and deserve, who will answer the call to your next emergency? Will they be healthy? Our nation's first responder agencies must provide a healthy and safe environment for these men and women to ask for help if they are struggling to deal with the trauma they've encountered. Our communities depend on them. Their families depend on them.",Documentary
